## Overview

/src/MSystem.js is an evergrowing MVC framework built on React with powerful Views, Controllers, and Models instead of a plain Component. The goals are to:

- Reduce the lines and complexity of React Apps
- Improve Reacts readability
- Improve Reacts reusability
- Improve Reacts maintainability
- Simplify data passing, events, and binding between frontend parent-child, child-parent, child-child, distantCousin-distantCousin relationships
- Offer an MVC alternative built on the popular React framework

## Instructions

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Issues

- (FIXED) Key error as seen in your console. Keys optimize rerendering performance for dynamic data. Will add fix in next commit
